Project objective: Performance evaluation of a model through transfer learning using the Feature Extractor and Fine-tuning techniques  

Selected model: VGG16  

Selected dataset: [Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bmadushanirodrigo/fracture-multi-region-x-ray-data)  

This dataset consists of fractured and non-fractured X-ray images covering all anatomical regions of the body, including lower limbs, upper limbs, lumbar, hips, knees, etc. The dataset is categorized into training, testing, and validation folders, each containing fractured and non-fractured radiographic images.  

Number of available images: 10,580 images  

Dataset split:  

- Training data: 9,246 images  
- Validation data: 828 images  
- Test data: 506 images
